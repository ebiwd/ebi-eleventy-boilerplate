# Visual Framework 2.0 patterns

If you need to manually install components, copy Visual Framework 2.0-compatible
components into this directory.

For components available in [vf-core](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core)
you can simply npm install them and they'll be available through the `vf-core-components`
symlink to `node_module/@visual-framework`.
